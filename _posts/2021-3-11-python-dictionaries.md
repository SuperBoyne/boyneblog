title: Python Dictionaries
---

Dictionaries are powerful items in Python. Here's a quick little intro to them.

## What's a dictionary?
A dictionary is a type of variable in Python. It's like a list, but with "keys". Here's an example:
<code>
mydictionary = {
  "key": "value"
}
</code>
To access a value in a dictionary, you access it like a list index. For example, `mydictionary["key"]` would return `"value"`.
## What good are dictionaries?
Well, you could make a dictionary with it.
<code>
dictionary = {
  "aardvark": "A medium-sized, burrowing, nocturnal mammal native to Africa.",
  "ant": "A little guy with legs"
}
</code>
You could use it to store blog posts (don't do this though).
<code>
blog = {
  "dictionaries": "Dictionaries are powerful items in Python. Here's a quick little intro to them."
}
</code>

## The end
I hope you learned something about dictionaries!
